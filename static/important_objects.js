// Excercise: check your avatar id by typing "avatar_id" in the
// console window. Avatar id, unlike player id can be made public - it
// simply identifies your avatar in the game. When other players will
// see your avatar on the radio, it will report the same avatar
// id. The same rule applies to all game objects - they all have ids.

// Now, that we are waiting for the server to return our avatar
// status, we can prepare an object that will hold our knowledge about
// the world in the game:

var objects = {};

// "Pantha rhei" - everything changes. Whenever we get data from the
// server, this data is valid at the moment it is generated. It should
// be useful to remember when we got this data. On order to do so, we
// will need a clock. We will hold it in this variable:

var current_time = 0;

// Certain objects that we will most probably use all the time are
// also worth saving. Each of them will be more deeply described in
// appropiate section later on.

var avatar;

// Radio will map our surroundings. Without a decent radio, we are
// basically blind.

var radio;

// Drive will provide us with thrust. Without drive, we wouldn't be
// able to move a bit. There are various kinds of drives. Initially
// you will get impulse drive - not very efficient but it can also be
// used as a defense mechanism.

var impulse_drive;

// Store and battery will store resources and energy.

var store, battery;

// Manipulator can grab and throw various objects. It can't generate
// thrust as big as impulse drive but is able to grab any object.

var manipulator;

// Later on we will use other kinds of objects - batteries, reactors,
// weapons, labs, various secret modules and even create our own,
// custom components.
