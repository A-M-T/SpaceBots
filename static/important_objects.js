// id. The same rule applies to all game objects - they all have ids.

// Now, that we are waiting for the server to return our avatar

// be useful to remember when we got this data. On order to do so, we

var current_time = 0;

// This function will get an object and integrate it into global
// database in the `objects` variable.

    // Some fields are always sent by the server. Their old values
    // may however remain from older reports. We should delete
    // these possibly invalid properties.

        // information about this particular object, the
        // server doesn't waste any bandwidth to send it
        // again. If you don't have any info then you can
        // request it using 'report' message.

        // When we already have the object scanned - we don't
        // need to issue 'report' command any more.
